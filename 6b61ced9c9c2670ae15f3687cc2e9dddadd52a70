For example, if a call looks like it takes 0 ns, then the whole run will be useless.\n\nThere is a bit of overhead included in these benchmarks (increment and check counter, branch back), but honestly, you cannot use these to get an absolute number. These are only really useful to do comparisons to determine if your new algorithm is better than the old one.",

Use the standard deviation to eliminate the extreme values call confidence interval, so that the value of each operation\u0027s time will be more precisely. \nI thought the individual call won\u0027t smaller than 1 ns, so each record should still be useful. \nThe overhead will increase indeed, but the efficiency of the benchmarks is not important than the result of correctness. If there have any mistake, please give me an error correction. \n\nThanks, \n-- Neal Liu",
